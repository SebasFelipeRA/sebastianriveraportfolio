# 🐭 High School Mouse-trap Powered Cart

In **Grade 11**, I discovered my passion for mechanics and the practical application of mathematics. That journey culminated in winning **3rd place** in the 2015 *"time rankings"* for fastest mousetrap-powered vehicle.

Despite having limited engineering knowledge and resources at the time, I was able to design and build a highly effective cart through:

- ✅ Careful material selection  
- ✅ Lightweight chassis design  
- ✅ Strategic placement of the mousetrap

By connecting an elongated arm to the wheels via **fishing line**, I maximized the duration of acceleration forces applied to the tires. The use of **rubber wheels** improved traction and enabled clean, straight-line travel — a key factor in success.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Reinforced early interest in **mechanical systems and control**
- Applied **STEM concepts** in a real-world physical prototype
- Sparked a lasting drive for **design, iteration, and testing**
