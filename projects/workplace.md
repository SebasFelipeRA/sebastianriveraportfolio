A running record of the skills, tools, and structured learning I’ve built alongside my engineering work.

* * *

## Focus Areas

- Design for manufacutrability and efficiency considerations when CMM is deployed
- AI / Computer Vision (model iteration, evaluation, practical deployment)
- Prototyping and repeatable operations (fixtures, process discipline, quality mindset)

* * *

## Tools & Engineering Habits

- Git + documentation discipline for repeatable work
- Debugging mindset: isolate → test → validate → document
- Building workflows that scale (consistent setups, clear checklists, clean handoffs)

* * *

## Leadership & Collaboration

- Led multiple group engineering projects (planning, task breakdown, delivery)
- Coaching experience (communication, accountability, helping others improve)
- Comfortable working cross-functionally with mechanical, electrical, and software teams

* * *

## Current Goals

- Stronger MLOps habits (reproducibility, packaging, deployment patterns)
- Better test/validation structure for robotics + embedded systems
- Continue improving quality operations and scalable workflows

> I treat learning like engineering: build, test, document, improve — repeat.
