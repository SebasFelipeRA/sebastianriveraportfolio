# 🔍 Autonomous Vehicle Perception System (GoWrench Project)

A Master’s-level engineering project focused on solving real-world mobility challenges using an autonomous off-road robot. Developed in collaboration with GoWrench Inc., this initiative integrates GNSS, ROS, and YOLO-based vision systems to support Level 4 autonomous navigation.

---

## Overview

In collaboration with GoWrench Inc., we developed a **Level 4 autonomous off-road navigation system** using ROS, GNSS localization, and real-time camera-based segmentation. The system enables robots to follow preplanned routes while navigating around obstacles with high precision using Jetson Orin and Oak-D cameras.

The project used the Husky UGV as a research platform and simulated GNSS and IMU data to validate algorithms before real-world deployment. Visual perception was enhanced using YOLOv8 and YOLOP models, which provided both semantic segmentation and depth estimation via stereo vision.
