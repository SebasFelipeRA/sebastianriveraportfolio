# 🛠️ CATIA V5R19 – Engine Reverse Engineering

In this project, my team and I manually disassembled a **General Motors Eco-Tec-4 engine** at the **McMaster Automotive Research Center**. The goal was to measure, model, and animate the entire engine using **CATIA V5R19**.

Despite limited access to precision equipment, we successfully created a functional CAD assembly by:

- 📏 Measuring key parts with basic tools
- ⚙️ Modeling major components in CATIA  
- 🧱 Focusing on **Block and Head design** (my responsibility)

Due to equipment limitations, we often made **educated assumptions** on less-critical dimensions. This highlighted the importance of **clear team communication**, as all five team members had to synchronize component design based on their individual measurements.

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- Modeled the **Engine Block and Head** from physical measurements  
- Collaborated with team members to align all CAD components  
- Helped animate a working virtual engine with motion constraints
