title: CNC Woodcutting with Genmitsu 3018-PROVer
permalink: /projects/cnc-woodcutting/
---

A hands-on personal project focused on CNC workflows — from CAD/CAM planning to fixturing, tool setup, and finished engraved parts.

* * *

## Overview

These project are where I practice repeatable CNC workflows: designing parts, preparing toolpaths, setting up the stock consistently, and refining the process until the output is clean and predictable. The goal is always the same: reliable results and a process I can reuse.

I started out only using the CNC to make fixtures and iterate prototypes, I soon realized I could accerlate this by purchasing a 3D printer to manufacture and design my fixturing. I am now following this workflow and have seen the benefits from a set up stand point and repeatablilty aspect as well since I can always trust in the origin of my work peice relative to the machine workspace.

#  Lessons Learned 

### Qaulity Fixturing
- A lesson I learned quickly in this art of cnc wood cutting was to ensure I workpiece was in a fixture that is rigid and reusable, set up time decreased and results become more apparent thier the repeatble detail I was able to accomplish with the coasters. 

### CAD / CAM Planning
- Another area where I relearned was the CAD and CAM planning, the CAM funtionality on fusion360 is powerful and I am able to use this machines full capabilities thorugh the nc code gneeration. Thorugh some reasech online and guidance from a cnc machine co worker, I was able to learn to understand the effects of toolpaths can have on finish and run time. 

### Quality & Iteration
- To ensure the finsihed I wanted was achived and repeatable, the feeds and speeds were tested, as the fine detiled I achieved was completed by a 0.1 mm V bit with a 20 degree chamfer, the speed and feed of this tool had to be very high for the tool wear rate to be a slow and gradual rate. This also allowed for a fine detail to be avchived.

### Creativity 
- During this process I have learned many things baout cnc and 3d printing, I have faced a few limitations that my hinder my creativity becuase of my cnc's workspace size and machine's rigidty. But this has only increased my engineering mindset to find other alternative methods to acheive what I envivsion.

## Skills Applied

- CNC workflows and manufacturing process thinking
- Practical prototyping and iteration 
- Fixture design mindset (repeatability + speed)
- Hands-on troubleshooting and improvement

## Future Enhancements

- Add a small “settings library” section (materials + bits + what worked)
- Expand into more complex 2.5D carving and inlays
- Build out a cabinet to store cnc and 3d printer, all in one place
- Enable wireless connectivity to the cnc
