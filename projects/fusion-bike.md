# 🚴‍♂️ Fusion 360 – Gear Driven Bike Design

Utilizing **Autodesk Fusion 360**, my team and I designed a futuristic **gear-driven bicycle** that differentiated itself through a modern, lightweight aesthetic.

I was responsible for:

- 🛞 **Tire, rim, and handlebar assembly design**
- 🧠 Incorporating inspiration from **racing bicycles**
- 🎨 Styling rim designs with **custom logo cutouts** for Kobe Bryant and LeBron James as a tribute to their legacy

The handlebars were modeled after racing bike geometry to maintain a lightweight and aerodynamic profile, while the rim assembly was optimized for futuristic appeal using carbon-inspired geometries.

> With creativity and originality, I compiled a bespoke rim design inspired by multiple performance-oriented bicycle rims.

_This project allowed me to blend technical accuracy with personal expression — resulting in models that are both mechanically sound and visually meaningful._
