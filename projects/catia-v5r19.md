# 🛠️ CATIA V5R19 – Engine Reverse Engineering

In this project, my team and I manually disassembled a **General Motors Eco-Tec-4 engine** at the **McMaster Automotive Research Center**. The goal was to measure, model, and animate the entire engine using **CATIA V5R19**.

Despite limited access to precision equipment, we successfully created a functional CAD assembly by:

- 📏 Measuring key parts with basic tools
- ⚙️ Modeling major components in CATIA  
- 🧱 Focusing on **Block and Head design** (my responsibility)

Due to equipment limitations, we often made **educated assumptions** on less-critical dimensions. This highlighted the importance of **clear team communication**, as all five team members had to synchronize component design based on their individual measurements.

## 🧠 Key Contributions

- Modeled the **Engine Block and Head** from physical measurements  
- Collaborated with team members to align all CAD components  
- Helped animate a working virtual engine with motion constraints

## 🧠 Reflections

Working with CATIA taught me precision design, model structuring best practices, and how small design changes can cascade through assemblies. It laid the groundwork for my proficiency in advanced CAD platforms like Fusion 360 and SolidWorks.
