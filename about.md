# 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Sebastian Rivera** — a Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for intelligent systems, electric motors, and hands-on innovation.

From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the mechanics of vehicles. That curiosity evolved into a deep interest in **automotive technology**, **AI-driven autonomy**, and **electric motor systems**. Today, I focus on projects that blend software, hardware, and control systems to create smarter machines.

When I’m not engineering or designing new systems, you’ll likely find me in my garage working on **CNC woodworking projects**. I love using tools like the **Genmitsu 3018-Prover** to design, cut, and engrave parts — blending creativity with precision craftsmanship.

## 🔧 My Interests

- 🚗 Automotive autonomy, GNSS/ROS navigation, and sensor fusion  
- 🧠 Machine learning for anomaly detection and optimization  
- ⚙️ Electric motor prototyping (especially SRMs)  
- 🪵 CNC woodworking and DIY fabrication projects  
- 💻 Embedded systems and rapid prototyping  

## 🛠️ Philosophy

I believe in learning by building. Whether it’s tuning a CNC machine, wiring a circuit, or testing a sensor, I’m always looking to bridge theory and real-world execution.
