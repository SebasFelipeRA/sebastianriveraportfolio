### 📄 Human Pose Estimation Using Deep Learning (PoseNet Project)

This project explores human pose estimation using multiple deep learning models including PoseNet, HRNet, MediaPipe, and OpenPose. The models were trained and evaluated using the COCO dataset. Our team assessed performance using standard metrics like mAP and PCK, and implemented pose keypoint visualizations with real-world input images.

- **Models Used**: PoseNet, HRNet, OpenPose, MediaPipe
- **Dataset**: Microsoft COCO val2017
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Training and evaluation of 4 pose estimation models
  - Deployment and benchmarking of PoseNet using TensorFlow and PyTorch
  - Visualization of keypoints and skeletons on test images
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, COCO API, OpenCV
