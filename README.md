## üöÄ Projects

### üîç Autonomous Vehicle Perception System
- **Description**:  This Master‚Äôs-level engineering project focused on solving real-world challenges in collaboration with community partners in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We developed a road and sidewalk segmentation system using YOLOP on NVIDIA Jetson Orin to enhance autonomous navigation and pedestrian safety. The project spanned two academic terms and involved structured planning, technical implementation, and public impact considerations. Project coordination, planning milestones, and stakeholder engagement were managed using Microsoft Teams, while final deliverables and presentations were developed using Microsoft PowerPoint
Below are links to the final technical report and project poster.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time segmentation of road environments
  - Edge deployment on Jetson with GNSS and ROS integration
- **Tech Stack**: Python, YOLOP, ROS, NVIDIA Jetson Orin, GNSS, Microsoft Teams, PowerPoint

### üìÑ Human Pose Estimation Using Deep Learning (PoseNet Project)

This project explored human pose estimation using four leading deep learning models: **PoseNet**, **HRNet**, **MediaPipe**, and **OpenPose**. The goal was to detect and visualize human body keypoints using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and benchmark model performance across real-world scenarios.

We used the **COCO val2017 dataset**, which includes 5,000+ images annotated with 17 keypoints per person. Our team evaluated each model using industry-standard metrics such as **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** and **Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK)**.

---

### üîß Implementation Highlights
As part of the implementation, we:
- Preprocessed over 5,000 COCO images for input standardization
- Compared model accuracy and inference performance across CPU and GPU environments
- Visualized predicted poses using OpenCV keypoint skeletons
- Integrated **PoseNet** via TensorFlow.js for lightweight, browser-based inference
- Benchmarked single-person and multi-person detection scenarios

---

### üîç Key Observations
- **PoseNet**: Fast and browser-deployable with lower accuracy (~63.9% PCK)
- **OpenPose**: Strong performance in multi-person detection (~72% PCK)
- **MediaPipe**: Balanced speed and accuracy for single-person use
- **HRNet**: Highest precision (~74.4% mAP) but most computationally intensive

### üìä Project Summary
- **Models Used**: PoseNet, HRNet, OpenPose, MediaPipe  
- **Dataset**: Microsoft COCO val2017  
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Trained and evaluated 4 advanced pose estimation models
  - Deployed PoseNet using TensorFlow.js and PyTorch
  - Rendered visual outputs with pose keypoints and skeletal structures

- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, COCO API, MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js
