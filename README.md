# 🤖 Skip-the-Servers: Autonomous Food Delivery Robot

A capstone project built to tackle the challenges of modern restaurant staffing with robotics and intelligent automation.

---

## Overview

**Skip-the-Servers** is a semi-autonomous food delivery robot developed during my Bachelor of Technology in Automotive and Vehicle Engineering Technology at McMaster University. Designed to address hygiene and staffing challenges in restaurants, the robot navigates autonomously, avoids obstacles, and presents food via a hygienic revolving tray mechanism.

This project was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic with extremely limited resources—no access to manufacturing equipment—requiring creative use of everyday materials, hand tools, and low-cost electronics. It was a true test of engineering under constraint, pushing me to innovate across mechanical design, embedded programming, and control systems.

# 🧍‍♂️ Human Pose Estimation Using Deep Learning (PoseNet Project)

A research-driven project focused on evaluating leading pose estimation models for real-time human keypoint detection using deep learning and computer vision.

---

## Overview

This project explored **human pose estimation** using four state-of-the-art models: **PoseNet**, **HRNet**, **MediaPipe**, and **OpenPose**. The primary goal was to detect and visualize human body keypoints in real-world scenarios using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

We utilized the **Microsoft COCO val2017 dataset** with over 5,000 images annotated with 17 human keypoints. Each model was benchmarked using industry-standard metrics such as **Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK)** and **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**.
